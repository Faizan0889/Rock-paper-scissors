## How to Get Started

### Prerequisites

To run this game, you need to have **Python 3** installed on your system.

  * **Installing Python:**
    1.  Go to the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    2.  Download the appropriate installer for your operating system (e.g., "Windows installer (64-bit)" for Windows).
    3.  Run the installer. **Important:** During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add python.exe to PATH"**. This will allow you to run Python commands from any directory.
    4.  Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
    5.  You can verify your installation by opening a command prompt/terminal and typing `python --version` and `pip --version`.

### Running the Game

1.  **Get the Code:** Copy the entire Python code for the Rock Paper Scissors game (which you have from our previous conversations).
2.  **Create the Game File:**
      * Open a simple text editor like **Notepad** (on Windows).
      * Paste the copied Python code into the empty document.
      * Save the file by going to `File > Save As...`.
      * In the "Save As" dialog:
          * Choose a location where you want to save your file (e.g., your Desktop or a dedicated `Projects` folder).
          * In the "File name" field, type `rock.py`.
          * Crucially, in the "Save as type" dropdown, select **"All Files (\*.\*)"** instead of "Text Documents (\*.txt)". This ensures it's saved as a Python file, not a text file.
          * Click "Save".
3.  **Open Command Prompt/Terminal:**
      * On Windows, search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" in your Start menu and open it.
      * Navigate to the directory where you saved your `rock.py` file using the `cd` command. For example, if you saved it on your Desktop, you would type `cd Desktop` and press Enter.
4.  **Execute the Game:** Once you are in the correct directory, type the following command and press Enter:
    ```bash
    python rock.py
    ```
    The game will start running in your terminal.
